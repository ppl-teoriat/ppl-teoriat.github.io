## Prerequisites

To begin using the Anki application, you will need the following:
- A computer or laptop
- An internet connection

The Anki application and the question bank are both free.

> **Note:** after doing the process described on this page, you will be able to use the questionbank on any device, such as a phone or a browser.
> However, for this first installation, you will need a computer or a laptop (Windows, Mac, or linux are all fine).

## Step 1: Creating an account

1. Open <https://ankiweb.net/about> in your browser
1. Click on `Sign Up`
1. Create an account for yourself
1. Accept the terms and conditions
1. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Installing the application

1. Open <https://apps.ankiweb.net/> in your browser
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
1. Press the `Download` button
    - Choose the Qt6 version if you are given the option
1. Install the application on your computer

If you need help with the installation, you can click on the `Installation & troubleshooting guide` button that can be found below the download links.
If the Qt6 version does not work, try installing the Qt5 version.

5. Open the Anki application and click on `Sync` in the top-right corner
1. Log in with your AnkiWeb account

## Step 3: Add-on

The question bank uses the `Multiple Choice for Anki` addon. We will now install it.

1. Click on the `Tools` menu in the navigation bar
1. Select `Add-ons`
1. Select `Get Add-ons`
1. Copy the number `1566095810` into the `Code` field
    - This is the ID for the Multiple Choice for Anki addon, which can be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1566095810)
1. Click `OK` twice
1. Restart Anki

For some users, the default addon colour scheme is a bit confusing.
You can change it as follows:

1. Click on the `Tools` menu in the navigation bar
1. Select `Add-ons`
1. Click on the `Multiple Choice for Anki` text
1. Change the text that says `DEFAULT_COLOURING` to say `ALTERNATE_COLORING`
1. Save by pressing `OK`

## Step 4: Downloading and installing the question bank

1. Open <https://ankiweb.net/shared/by-author/365788332> in your browser
    - You will find all of the questions and answers split into examination subjects here
    - The subjects that start with `EN` are in English. Correspondingly, the ones that start with `FI` are in Finnish
1. Click on the name of the subject you want to install
1. Scroll down and click on `Download`
    - This will download an Anki `.apkg` file
1. Open your computer's Downloads folder
1. Double-click the file you downloaded
    - This will open the file in Anki
1. Press `Import`
1. Repeat steps 2-6 until you have installed all of the subjects you want

Finally, **press the `Sync` button again** to synchronise your installed questionbank with the AnkiWeb server.

> **Note:** if, for whatever reason, you cannot access the AnkiWeb page,
> you can download the files directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppl-teoriat/ppl-teoriat.github.io/tree/main/questionbank/apkg). 


## Well done!

You can now revise for your aviation theoretical exam using Anki.

If you would also like to install a mobile application for revising on-the-go, continue to [**Mobile installation instructions**](/mobile)

If you only want to revise on your computer or browser, you can skip the mobile installation section and continue straight to the [**Anki usage instructions**](/usage)
