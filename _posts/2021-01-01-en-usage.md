This is a quick introduction to using Anki for revision.

## When do I start practicing?

Before starting to practice for a specific subject's exam, make sure to learn the theoretical material first.
If you start practicing too early, you will only remember the answers and won't understand why they are correct.

I recommend starting to use Anki for revising a certain topic right after you have learnt all of its theory.
By doing this, you will remember the theory and understand the questions better.

If you do not understand why some answer is correct, check your theory material.
It's also recommended to discuss the matter with a CFI or theory instructor.

## How do I use Anki?

1. Choose the subject you want to revise for
1. You will be shown a question and four answer choices
1. Choose one answer from the list and confirm it
    - On a computer or in the browser, you confirm your selection by pressing the `Show answer` button
    - On a mobile device, you confirm your selection by tapping underneath the answer choices
1. Check whether you got it right
    - If you didn't, find an explanation for the right answer in your theory material or ask a CFI
1. Choose how difficult you found the question
    - Anki does not penalise you for incorrect answers on its own
    - The options are `Again`, `Hard`, `Good`, and `Easy`.
    - Every option has a number above it that tells when the question will be shown again.
    For example, `<10m` means that the question will be shown again in less than 10 minutes, while `3w` means that the question will be shown again in three weeks.
1. Practice the questions until Anki says that there are no more questions for the day. You will get new questions the next day
    - Rest is important: Anki has question limits for a reason!

## How long do I use Anki for?

The more questions you answer, the less frequently they will show up.
If you put in some good effort and revise the questions regularly, then it is possible to get to a situation where Anki no longer shows you questions as they will all show up in a few months' or years' time.
At this point, you can be quite sure that you remember it all by heart!

I suggest that you continue using Anki even after completing your theoretical examination at Traficom.
Even if you've passed the exam, a good knowledge and understaing of theory will help you fly.
If you practice enough before your exam, then revising afterwards will be a breeze: Anki will only show you questions rarely, and it does not take much effort to answer them.
